# Directed Weighted Graph
This project aims to construct a graph, perform certain alogirthms on it, and to simulate it through a graphical user interface.

## Graph implementation
Our method of representing a graph with a group of edges and vertices, G (V,E) is with two hashmaps:
One hash map for the edges for which each Edge has a string key containing the source vertex and destination vertex.
Second hash map for the vertices for which each Vertex has a unique id, weight and position in a 2D plane.

## Algorithm implementations
There are several interesting methods to perform on our graph, such as:
### Connected
Can each pair of vertices reach one another?
### Shortest path between two vertices
Minimal distance between two vertices.
### Traveling salesman problem
Given a list of vertices, returns an approximation of the shortest path that passes through them.
### Which node is the center
Which vertex is the closest to all other vertices.

## Graphical user interface implementation
